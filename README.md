# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project was a quick mock photography website that I made about myself. Since there were a lot of requirements for the project I based the project around those, opposed to having a complete goal for the website itself.

home.html is the homepage of the website where the user will first interface.

about.html is a short introduction about myself.

gallery.html is a sample of photos that I have taken.

contact.html is the contact page where you can submit a name, email, and short message to me.

/PG is a folder that contains all the photos I used throughout the site.

style.scss is the sass file that contains all my styling for the website and that created the style.css and style.css.map files.
