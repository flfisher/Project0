            <h4><b>Hey there, I'm Ford Fisher</b></h4>
            <br>
            <p>Born and raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana, I'm an ambitious young engineering student. I attend Purdue University and study biomedical engineering with a certificate in entrepreneurship.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During this past school year, I made the decision to pursue a co-op position at a medical device company. On the job, I developed hands-on skills that I wouldn't have gotten through a classroom setting. With the extra time I had in the evenings from not having school work to do, I decided to learn web developing. I have learned a lot about front-end developing through free online courses and self-given projects, but there is still a lot left for me to learn.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Due to the global pandemic, I was laid off from my co-op position and now I have all my time to dedicate towards obtaining a more in-depth grasp of how the whole development process comes together.</p>
